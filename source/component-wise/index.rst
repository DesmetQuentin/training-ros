1. Component-wise frameworks
============================

Running the coupled model basically consists of running both components at the same
time in their OASIS-enabled version, making it essential to understand first how they
work independently. Therefore, as a first step in this training, we will get to
**understand each component's distinct framework**, ultimately **running uncoupled
simulations** and getting through their specific **outputs**.

Whether to start by RegCM or SYMPHONIE does not matter here, although you'll get a more
progressive difficulty by starting with RegCM, whose execution is more straightforward.
