2. Coupling both components
===========================

Now that we understand each component's framework and know how to set up and execute
simulations of their standalone version, we are ready to couple the two.
This part of the training divided in two.
First, we will go through all namelists relating to the use of OASIS, understand and
practice how we can configure the coupling fields we need.
Second and lat, we will actually run coupled simulations.
