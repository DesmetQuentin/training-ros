Running and outputs
===================

After :doc:`initialization <initialize>`, we need to set and reset parameters of our
notebooks and batch script to prepare our uncoupled simulation.

First, change/check the values of the following **notebook parameters**:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - File
     - Variable and value
     - Comment
   * - ``notebook_time.f``
     - ``run_option = 0``
     - Disables the initialization mode
   * - ``notebook_grid.f``
     - ``nbdom_imax = 7`` and ``nbdom_jmax = 6`` on CALMIP/``nbdom_imax = 8`` and ``nbdom_jmax = 6`` on HILO
     - Keep the initial grid dimensions
   * - ``notebook_grid.f``
     - ``mpi_map_file_name = 'description_domaine.next'`` and ``mpi_hole_plugging = 'description_trous.txt'``
     - Files generated by the :doc:`initialization <initialize>`
   

Then, **edit the** ``job.sh`` **batch script**:

* Set the ``--job-name`` batch parameter to ``'symphonie'``.
* Set ``NPROC`` as indicated in the header of ``description_domaine.next``.
* Accordingly, set the ``--nodes`` batch parameter back to 1.
* Check that ``EXE`` is ``./bin/ORIGIN/symphonie.exe``.

      .. tab-item:: HILO

         .. code:: bash

            TODO


Next, **empty the** ``tmp`` **folder**:

.. code:: bash

   rm tmp/*


.. important::

   SYMPHONIE will **fail immediately if** ``tmp`` **is not empty.**

   You might want to add a ``rm tmp/*`` line to your batch script.
   However this is not advised because the ``tmp`` directory contains a number of files
   which might be important for you in some situations in the future, in which case
   you should always be fully aware when deleting the content of ``tmp``.
   It is thus preferred to type ``rm tmp/*`` manually before every rerun of your
   SYMPHONIE simulations.


Finally, **submit** the job with ``sbatch``, **check** on it with ``squeue``, and the
run should complete successfully after some time, with the following tail to its slurm
output:

.. code:: console

   $ tail slurm_symphonie*.out
    ____  __ __  ____        ___   __  _ 
   |    \|  |  ||    \      /   \ |  |/ ]
   |  D  )  |  ||  _  |    |     ||  | / 
   |    /|  |  ||  |  |    |  O  ||    \ 
   |    \|  :  ||  |  |    |     ||     |
   |  .  \     ||  |  |    |     ||  .  |
   |__|\_|\__,_||__|__|     \___/ |__|\_|


   Open /users/p20055/desmet/SYMPHONIE/SOURCES/model_name to see what's new in this version of the model


The ``GRAPHICS`` and ``OFFLINE`` folders should now also contain several files, each
containing one timestep, with the fields requested in the ``notebook_graph`` and
``notebook_offline.f``, respectively. Feel free to explore their content using
``ncview`` and/or ``ncdump -h``.

.. note::

   Notice that **none of the files in** ``GRAPHICS`` **and** ``OFFLINE`` **contains grid
   information**. Indeed, those are saved in a separate file: ``tmp/grid.nc``. However,
   if you open it with a visual tool like ``ncview``, you will notice that grid
   information is only available for the meshes of the MPI grid that contain ocean
   cells, while other meshes only display ``NaN``. This can be problematic for
   conducting preprocessing with other tools like Python for instance. This is why
   we saved the ``grid.nc`` file produced during :doc:`initialization <initialize>`.
   Initialization's ``grid.nc`` is thus *the* file you will need for interpreting and
   postprocessing your simulation outputs.
