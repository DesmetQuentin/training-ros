Install RegCM
=============

To install RegCM, we will follow these four steps:
**bootstrap**, **configure**, **compile**, and **install**.

First, get to RegCM root:

.. code:: bash

   cd $REGCM


**Bootstrap** the installation process with the following:

.. code:: bash

   ./bootstrap.sh


This should generate the ``configure`` program based on ``configure.ac``. This program
will **configure** the maker, i.e, generating all Makefiles necessary for the
installation, based on your environment and a number of optional arguments. You may run
``./configure --help`` to see all possible options. In our case, we will use the two
configurations below, but for now, only run the OASIS-enabled version.

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: OASIS-enabled

      .. code:: bash

         ./configure FC=ifort --enable-pnetcdf --enable-clm45 --enable-oasis --with-oasis-comm=MPI1 --with-oasis-path=$OASIS/intel18_calmip


   .. tab-item:: OASIS-disabled

      .. code:: bash

         ./configure FC=ifort --enable-pnetcdf --enable-clm45


.. tip::

   You can compile RegCM with debugging flags by providing the ``--enable-debug``
   argument to ``configure``.


Then, **compilation** can be started by typing:

.. code:: bash

   make


This may take several minutes. After that, you can proceed to the **installation** with:

.. code:: bash

   make install


Once this is finished, you should see many executables in ``$REGCM/bin``:

.. code:: console

   average                            icbcPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS        pgwbcPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS

   clmbcPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS           interp_emissions               regrid
   clmsaMPIPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS        interp_emissions_bioburn.sh    sigma2pPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS
   emcre_gridPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS      interpinicPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS  sigma2zPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS
   GrADSNcPlotPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS     interp_pollen                  sstPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS
   GrADSNcPreparePNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS  mksurfdataPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS  terrainPNETCDF_CLM45_OASIS


Some are for preprocessing, some are postprocessing tools, while the ``regcmMPI*``
program is the main executable.

Notice how the options we gave to ``configure`` are now suffixes of most executables
(those which actually depend on those options). This allows you to conduct the
installation procedure several times with various options, without loosing previous
installation programs.


.. admonition:: Cleaning commands

   RegCM's Makefile provide two cleaning commands:

   .. tab-set::

      .. tab-item:: Clean

         .. code:: bash

            make clean

         
         removes all compilation results to allow you running ``make`` from scratch, but
         based on the same configuration as initially chosen through the ``configure``
         program.


      .. tab-item:: Distclean

         .. code:: bash

            make distclean

         
         not only removes all compilation results but also the Makefiles generated by
         the ``configure`` program, such that any ``make`` command will fail after that.
         This implies that you need to start over at the configuring stage before using
         ``make`` again.


With the OASIS-enabled executable, RegCM cannot run in uncoupled mode. In order to
follow the parts of this training focusing on the standalone components, we thus **need
to install an OASIS-disabled executable as well**. To do so, make a ``distclean`` to
prepare the change of configuration, then go back to the configuration stage, follow the
OASIS-disabled tab, and continue with the same installation steps. You should finally
get new executables with a suffix in ``PNETCDF_CLM45`` (i.e., without the additional
``_OASIS`` like for the first version).
