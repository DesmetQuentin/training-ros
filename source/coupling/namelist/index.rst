Configuration and practice
==========================

RegCM and SYMPHONIE will communicate through OASIS based on the parameters set up in
their own namelist framework as well as in a ``namcouple`` file which will be
specifically read by the OASIS library at run time. In this section, we will first
explain about the ``namcouple`` file. Then, the components' OASIS-related namelists will
be presented. Lastly, we will practice configuring with some field exchange cases,
navigating throughout OASIS, RegCM and SYMPHONIE's namelist frameworks consistently.
